Yukiko Kobayashi — Farmers Insurance (Static Website Template)
=========================================================

What this is:
- A clean, compliant, single‑page website you can deploy on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your agency site host.
- Edit index.html to add your direct phone, email, license number, and photos.
- Replace /assets/farmers-mark.svg with your approved mark if needed (follow Farmers brand rules).

How to deploy on GitHub Pages (quick):
1) Create a public repo named 'yukiko-farmers-site' on GitHub.
2) Upload the files in this folder (index.html, styles.css, /assets).
3) In the repo settings > Pages, choose 'Deploy from branch' and select 'main' and '/ (root)'. Save.
4) Your site will publish shortly; copy the Pages URL into your email signature or QR code.

Sections you may customize:
- Hero: headline, subhead, and quote form (no PHI/PII beyond basic contact info).
- Services and Bundles: keep language factual (no rate guarantees) and remove any features not offered in your state.
- Life: add your state availability and product notes per compliance.
- About: update milestones and add your CA License number and any awards (if allowed).

Compliance notes:
- No coverage is bound until confirmed in writing.
- Product availability varies by state.
- For life insurance, include issuer language and state availability as appropriate.
